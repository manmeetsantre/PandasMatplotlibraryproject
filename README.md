Hi
This is my project made with the the help of Pandas library and also using Matplotlib library
I have made this using my prior knowledge from class 12th Informatics Practices subject.
In this I have tried to make a visual representation of the given data in the dataframe format using pandas and then creating the visual representation using different attributes of matplotlib.
I can also import data from a csv file but for that I have to get someone's data, so to avoid that I have created an imaginary data in the dataframe.
Thank you.
